There are many web pages that contains big lists of information constantly updated. As someone would repeatedly search for a set of interesting words that also could be a large set, it would be interesting to save those words and automatically search for them as the web page is updated.
Back when IRC was used as an keep-updated-tool, this feature was called THE NoTifY LiST. Here I'm calling it Pearls, for some reason (I'll find out which someday).

Check the downloads sections.
Alternatively, you can visit the Google chrome's extension gallery and install it through there:
