There are many web pages that contain large lists of information that are constantly updated.
When repeatedly searching for multiple interesting words (which could be a large set), it would
be useful to save those words and automatically search for them as the web page is updated.
Pearls provides this functionality and allows you to specify sets of words per page, domain, or for all pages.

You should reload your pages after installing the extension.

Last Update 1.0.9.1:

- Added a backup button to ensure data safety for an upcoming Chrome update that might
  disable the extension after June 15

Google Chrome is requiring extension developers to make major changes on how their extensions work.
I am currently working on this and hope the migration can be finished soon before problems affect users.
I am deeply sorry if you get impacted. Pearls has not received my attention in a while since my current job does not give me time to do more development at home.
However, after this migration is finished, I do plan to give more time to Pearls and satisfy some common user requests.
